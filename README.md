# -Multi-level-Queue-Algorithm
take inputs from the user
take the following inputs from the user: no of the queue,  priority value (consider ) of every queue, no of processes and their respective - id, arrival time, burst time, and priority. 

It will then simulate the scheduling algorithm. Lastly, after the end of the simulation, it will print output in proper format report which contains the following:  the sequence (Gantt chart ) of execution, then for every process - arrival time, burst time, response time, waiting time, turnaround time.
